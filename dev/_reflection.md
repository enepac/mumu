# Reflection Log

---

## Reflection 1 — Covenant Formation
**Date:** 2025-09-28  
**Focus:** Governance, structure, and autonomy  
**Insight:** Defining GPT as architect/enforcer created precision and prevented enhancement drift.  

---

## Reflection 2 — Stack & Scaffold
**Date:** 2025-09-29  
**Focus:** Engineering foundations  
**Lesson:** Adopting proven big-tech blueprints accelerates solo development alignment with industry norms.  

---

## Reflection 3 — Supabase & Connectivity
**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Focus:** Backend data flow  
**Lesson:** Early validation of database schema ensured RAG/data reliability from day 1.  

---

## Reflection 4 — CI/CD Pipeline Maturity
**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Focus:** Automation discipline  
**Observation:** Immutable CI/CD gates improved build confidence and eliminated drift.  

---

## Reflection 5 — Deployment & Environment Reliability
**Date:** 2025-10-04 AM  
**Focus:** Runtime stability  
**Lesson:** Fly.io deployment surfaced dependency alignment needs; environment sealing completed.  

---

## Reflection 6 — Observability & Guardrails
**Date:** 2025-10-04 PM  
**Focus:** Operational visibility, monitoring, security posture  
**Insights:**
- Sentry + Pino integration revealed clear runtime insights.  
- Maintaining atomic commits allowed controlled augmentation without breaking baseline.  
- Fly.io verified health check reliability post-integration.  
**Next Steps:**
- v0.1.5 → Integrate Jest/Playwright with CI coverage.  
- v0.1.6 → Enable Dependabot + CodeQL.  
- v0.1.7 → Establish telemetry export to Grafana Cloud + Supabase logs.

## Rollback Drill — Baseline v0.1
Date: 2025-10-03

- Successfully rolled back to baseline/v0.1 using `git reset --hard baseline/v0.1`.
- Verified repo history aligned with baseline commits only.
- Confirmed rollback discipline and reproducibility.
- Restored latest with `git reset --hard origin/main`.
- ✅ Rollback drill passed — baseline integrity guaranteed.

## Reflection — v0.1.4 Observability & Guardrails

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Engineer:** Enrico Acha  
**Focus:** Stability validation, observability wiring, backend discipline.

### Insights
- Integrating observability early dramatically improves operational trust.
- Fly.io health checks exposed real gaps in environment variable management — resolved by codifying `.env` discipline and runtime fallbacks.
- The `atomic commit` principle continues to protect stability; the system remains reproducible and revertible at every baseline.

### Lessons
- Future instrumentation (Grafana, Supabase logs) should flow through the same observability layer (not direct DB polling).
- Covenant enforcement ensured the sequence stayed linear — no enhancement drift occurred.
- We confirmed our guardrail foundation before extending to testing and telemetry (v0.1.5 → v0.1.7).

### Next Direction
Proceed to:
- v0.1.5 → Add Jest + Playwright with coverage and CI validation.
- v0.1.6 → Integrate Dependabot + CodeQL.
- v0.1.7 → Extend telemetry pipeline to Grafana Cloud & Supabase logs.

## [Part 1 → Task 1.4] Configure Jest + Playwright Tests with Coverage Reports
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Executor:** suberu  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.1.4-observability-guardrails  
**Summary:**
- Installed `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`, `@babel/preset-react`, and `ts-node`.  
- Created `/jest.config.ts` to run unit tests only and isolate Playwright E2E tests.  
- Added Babel presets for React (JSX) and TypeScript transformation.  
- Verified sample Jest test passes and coverage report generated under `/coverage/`.  
- Confirmed CI compatibility; global coverage gate temporarily relaxed per Covenant Phase 1 criteria.  

**Outcome:**  
✅ Test pipeline operational; Playwright and Jest separated; coverage reports functional; ready for baseline v0.1.5.  

## [Part 1 → Task 1.4 – Dependabot + CodeQL Guardrails]
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Summary:**  
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly dependency updates.  
- Added `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` for automated vulnerability scanning.  
**Outcome:**  
✅ Security & supply-chain guardrails active. Ready for baseline v0.1.6.

**Baseline Adjustment:**  
Previous baseline/v0.1.6 existed. Created new tag baseline/v0.1.7 to preserve immutability and record final validation of Dependabot + CodeQL guardrails.
