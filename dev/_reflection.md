## Reflection 6 — Observability & Guardrails
**Date:** 2025-10-04 PM  
**Focus:** Operational visibility, monitoring, security posture  
**Insights:**
- Sentry + Pino integration revealed clear runtime insights.  
- Maintaining atomic commits allowed controlled augmentation without breaking baseline.  
- Fly.io verified health check reliability post-integration.  
**Next Steps:**
- v0.1.5 → Integrate Jest/Playwright with CI coverage.  
- v0.1.6 → Enable Dependabot + CodeQL.  
- v0.1.7 → Establish telemetry export to Grafana Cloud + Supabase logs.

## Rollback Drill — Baseline v0.1
Date: 2025-10-03

- Successfully rolled back to baseline/v0.1 using `git reset --hard baseline/v0.1`.
- Verified repo history aligned with baseline commits only.
- Confirmed rollback discipline and reproducibility.
- Restored latest with `git reset --hard origin/main`.
- ✅ Rollback drill passed — baseline integrity guaranteed.

## Reflection — v0.1.4 Observability & Guardrails

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Engineer:** Enrico Acha  
**Focus:** Stability validation, observability wiring, backend discipline.

### Insights
- Integrating observability early dramatically improves operational trust.
- Fly.io health checks exposed real gaps in environment variable management — resolved by codifying `.env` discipline and runtime fallbacks.
- The `atomic commit` principle continues to protect stability; the system remains reproducible and revertible at every baseline.

### Lessons
- Future instrumentation (Grafana, Supabase logs) should flow through the same observability layer (not direct DB polling).
- Covenant enforcement ensured the sequence stayed linear — no enhancement drift occurred.
- We confirmed our guardrail foundation before extending to testing and telemetry (v0.1.5 → v0.1.7).

### Next Direction
Proceed to:
- v0.1.5 → Add Jest + Playwright with coverage and CI validation.
- v0.1.6 → Integrate Dependabot + CodeQL.
- v0.1.7 → Extend telemetry pipeline to Grafana Cloud & Supabase logs.

## [Part 1 → Task 1.4] Configure Jest + Playwright Tests with Coverage Reports
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Executor:** suberu  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.1.4-observability-guardrails  
**Summary:**
- Installed `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`, `@babel/preset-react`, and `ts-node`.  
- Created `/jest.config.ts` to run unit tests only and isolate Playwright E2E tests.  
- Added Babel presets for React (JSX) and TypeScript transformation.  
- Verified sample Jest test passes and coverage report generated under `/coverage/`.  
- Confirmed CI compatibility; global coverage gate temporarily relaxed per Covenant Phase 1 criteria.  

**Outcome:**  
✅ Test pipeline operational; Playwright and Jest separated; coverage reports functional; ready for baseline v0.1.5.  

## [Part 1 → Task 1.4 – Dependabot + CodeQL Guardrails]
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Summary:**  
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly dependency updates.  
- Added `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` for automated vulnerability scanning.  
**Outcome:**  
✅ Security & supply-chain guardrails active. Ready for baseline v0.1.6.

**Baseline Adjustment:**  
Previous baseline/v0.1.6 existed. Created new tag baseline/v0.1.7 to preserve immutability and record final validation of Dependabot + CodeQL guardrails.

**Branch Transition — Initiation of Task 1.5**
- From: enhancement/v0.1.4-observability-guardrails  
- To: enhancement/v0.1.5-observability-docs  
- Based On: baseline/v0.1.7a  
- Purpose: Begin Part 1 → Task 1.5 (Observability & Documentation)  
- Status: Clean working tree; dependency locks committed before transition.

**Dependency Substitution (Task 1.5 → Subtask 1):**
Unable to reach npm registry for @logrocket/browser due to network or regional block.
Replaced with unscoped `logrocket` package (identical API). Verified installation integrity and API compatibility.

## [Part 1 → Task 1.5 → Subtask 1.1] Pino Structured Logger Setup
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Executor:** suberu  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.1.5-observability-docs  
**Summary:**  
- Implemented Pino JSON logger in `src/lib/logger.ts`.  
- Verified via Node runtime (CommonJS build + esModuleInterop).  
- Output confirmed structured and colorized in dev mode.  

**Outcome:**  
✅ Logger pipeline operational and ready for observability integration.  

**Config Compliance (Task 1.5 → Subtask 1.2):**
- Renamed `next.config.js` → `next.config.mjs` to satisfy ESM import enforcement.
- Removed all `require()` usage to comply with `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports`.
- Verified ESLint clean run and Next.js configuration load.

### 🔍 Issue 1 — TypeScript ESM Interop Failure
**Error Message:**  
`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and `Unknown file extension ".ts"` when running `ts-node` or `node --loader ts-node/esm`.

**Root Cause:**  
Node 22 + Next 15 required proper ESM interop, but `tsconfig.json` lacked correct `moduleResolution` and `esModuleInterop` alignment with Next.js’s build pipeline.

**Fix Applied:**  
- Updated `tsconfig.json` with `"module": "esnext"` and `"esModuleInterop": true`.  
- Switched execution to `pnpm exec next dev` for environment-consistent execution.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Treat Next.js as the entry point for TypeScript execution — avoid direct `node` imports of TS modules outside Next’s runtime.

---

### ⚙️ Issue 2 — Pino Logger Interop Error
**Error Message:**  
`Module ... can only be default-imported using the 'esModuleInterop' flag.`

**Root Cause:**  
`pino` uses `export = pino;`, which breaks with ES imports unless `esModuleInterop` is enabled.

**Fix Applied:**  
Enabled `"esModuleInterop": true` in `tsconfig.json`.  
Recompiled logger using:  
`pnpm tsc src/lib/logger.ts --module commonjs --esModuleInterop --outDir dist`.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Legacy CommonJS modules require explicit interop flags for type safety and runtime consistency.

---

### 🧩 Issue 3 — ESLint 9 Flat-Config Migration Errors
**Error Messages:**  
- “plugins key must be an object”  
- “A configuration object is using the env key”  
- “Could not find plugin prettier”  

**Root Cause:**  
Migration to ESLint 9 (flat-config system) incompatible with old `.eslintrc`.  
Plugins like Prettier and TypeScript had to be imported as objects instead of string arrays.

**Fix Applied:**  
Created `eslint.config.mjs` with:
- `import js from "@eslint/js"`  
- Explicit `plugins: { "@typescript-eslint": plugin, prettier: plugin }`  
- Added `prettierConfig` last for conflict resolution.  

**Lesson Learned:**  
ESLint v9+ requires fully object-based plugin definitions; compat layers must be removed for reliability.

---

### 🧠 Issue 4 — Next.js Config Key Misuse (`sentry` Field)
**Error Message:**  
`Invalid next.config.mjs options detected: Unrecognized key(s): 'sentry'`

**Root Cause:**  
Sentry v10.18 with Next 15 no longer accepts a top-level `sentry:` config object.  
Integration must wrap the entire Next config via `withSentryConfig()`.

**Fix Applied:**  
Rewrote `next.config.mjs` to:  
```js
import { withSentryConfig } from "@sentry/nextjs";
export default withSentryConfig(moduleExports, sentryWebpackPluginOptions);

Lesson Learned:
Always delegate plugin configuration through official wrappers to avoid schema drift as Next.js evolves.

🧰 Issue 5 — Instrumentation Hook Failures

Symptoms & Errors:

browserTracingIntegration is not a function

getCurrentHub is not a function

Type 'BrowserTracing' is not assignable to type 'Integration'

Root Cause:
API surface changes between @sentry/browser, @sentry/tracing, and @sentry/nextjs v10.x.
Incorrect imports from deprecated paths caused type and runtime conflicts.

Fix Applied:

Removed deprecated packages (@sentry/browser, @sentry/tracing).

Used only @sentry/nextjs for both server and client.

Rewrote src/instrumentation.ts to call Sentry.init({ dsn, tracesSampleRate, integrations: [ Sentry.captureConsoleIntegration() ] }).

Validated via pnpm exec tsc --noEmit → no errors.

Lesson Learned:
For Next.js 15+, all Sentry features (client and server) are unified under @sentry/nextjs; mixing old modules breaks integration.

🪵 Issue 6 — OpenTelemetry Warnings

Warning Message:
Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression

Root Cause:
This is a known benign warning from OpenTelemetry’s dynamic loader inside Sentry’s OTEL integration.

Fix Applied:
None required; documented and suppressed for CI/CD noise control.

Lesson Learned:
Not all warnings require patches — some are safe runtime artifacts from instrumentation libraries.

🧩 Issue 7 — Build Failure TypeError: ((intermediate value) || []) is not iterable

Root Cause:
Misplaced spread syntax in next.config.mjs during Sentry config merging.

Fix Applied:
Converted next.config.mjs to CommonJS (next.config.cjs) with explicit module.exports = withSentryConfig(...).

Lesson Learned:
Next.js 15 ESM interop is still sensitive; CommonJS remains the safest approach for plugin composition.

🧩 Issue 8 — Line-Ending Warnings

Message:
CRLF will be replaced by LF the next time Git touches it

Root Cause:
Windows environment saving files with CRLF; Git auto-normalizing to LF.

Fix Applied:
No action needed — accepted Git’s auto-conversion.
Optional setting git config core.autocrlf true documented for developer machines.

Lesson Learned:
Normalize line endings to LF for cross-platform consistency.

🧭 Final Validation

✅ pnpm exec tsc --noEmit → no type errors
✅ pnpm lint → clean
✅ pnpm build → succeeded with expected OTEL warnings
✅ pnpm dev → API routes active and observability operational

📘 Key Takeaways

-Favor modular CJS configs for mixed plugin systems (Sentry + Next).
-Centralize observability under one package to avoid version drift.
-Track every fix in reflection logs for Covenant audit traceability.
-Maintain LF line endings and atomic commit discipline for all baselines.
