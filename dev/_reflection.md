## Reflection 6 ‚Äî Observability & Guardrails
**Date:** 2025-10-04 PM  
**Focus:** Operational visibility, monitoring, security posture  
**Insights:**
- Sentry + Pino integration revealed clear runtime insights.  
- Maintaining atomic commits allowed controlled augmentation without breaking baseline.

**Next Steps:**
- v0.1.5 ‚Üí Integrate Jest/Playwright with CI coverage.  
- v0.1.6 ‚Üí Enable Dependabot + CodeQL.  
- v0.1.7 ‚Üí Establish telemetry export to Grafana Cloud + Supabase logs.

## Rollback Drill ‚Äî Baseline v0.1
Date: 2025-10-03

- Successfully rolled back to baseline/v0.1 using `git reset --hard baseline/v0.1`.
- Verified repo history aligned with baseline commits only.
- Confirmed rollback discipline and reproducibility.
- Restored latest with `git reset --hard origin/main`.
- ‚úÖ Rollback drill passed ‚Äî baseline integrity guaranteed.

## Reflection ‚Äî v0.1.4 Observability & Guardrails

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Engineer:** Enrico Acha  
**Focus:** Stability validation, observability wiring, backend discipline.

### Insights
- Integrating observability early dramatically improves operational trust.
- Fly.io health checks exposed real gaps in environment variable management ‚Äî resolved by codifying `.env` discipline and runtime fallbacks.
- The `atomic commit` principle continues to protect stability; the system remains reproducible and revertible at every baseline.

### Lessons
- Future instrumentation (Grafana, Supabase logs) should flow through the same observability layer (not direct DB polling).
- Covenant enforcement ensured the sequence stayed linear ‚Äî no enhancement drift occurred.
- We confirmed our guardrail foundation before extending to testing and telemetry (v0.1.5 ‚Üí v0.1.7).

### Next Direction
Proceed to:
- v0.1.5 ‚Üí Add Jest + Playwright with coverage and CI validation.
- v0.1.6 ‚Üí Integrate Dependabot + CodeQL.
- v0.1.7 ‚Üí Extend telemetry pipeline to Grafana Cloud & Supabase logs.

## [Part 1 ‚Üí Task 1.4] Configure Jest + Playwright Tests with Coverage Reports
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Executor:** suberu  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.1.4-observability-guardrails  
**Summary:**
- Installed `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`, `@babel/preset-react`, and `ts-node`.  
- Created `/jest.config.ts` to run unit tests only and isolate Playwright E2E tests.  
- Added Babel presets for React (JSX) and TypeScript transformation.  
- Verified sample Jest test passes and coverage report generated under `/coverage/`.  
- Confirmed CI compatibility; global coverage gate temporarily relaxed per Covenant Phase 1 criteria.  

**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ Test pipeline operational; Playwright and Jest separated; coverage reports functional; ready for baseline v0.1.5.  

## [Part 1 ‚Üí Task 1.4 ‚Äì Dependabot + CodeQL Guardrails]
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Summary:**  
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly dependency updates.  
- Added `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` for automated vulnerability scanning.  
**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ Security & supply-chain guardrails active. Ready for baseline v0.1.6.

**Baseline Adjustment:**  
Previous baseline/v0.1.6 existed. Created new tag baseline/v0.1.7 to preserve immutability and record final validation of Dependabot + CodeQL guardrails.

**Branch Transition ‚Äî Initiation of Task 1.5**
- From: enhancement/v0.1.4-observability-guardrails  
- To: enhancement/v0.1.5-observability-docs  
- Based On: baseline/v0.1.7a  
- Purpose: Begin Part 1 ‚Üí Task 1.5 (Observability & Documentation)  
- Status: Clean working tree; dependency locks committed before transition.

**Dependency Substitution (Task 1.5 ‚Üí Subtask 1):**
Unable to reach npm registry for @logrocket/browser due to network or regional block.
Replaced with unscoped `logrocket` package (identical API). Verified installation integrity and API compatibility.

## [Part 1 ‚Üí Task 1.5 ‚Üí Subtask 1.1] Pino Structured Logger Setup
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Executor:** suberu  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.1.5-observability-docs  
**Summary:**  
- Implemented Pino JSON logger in `src/lib/logger.ts`.  
- Verified via Node runtime (CommonJS build + esModuleInterop).  
- Output confirmed structured and colorized in dev mode.  

**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ Logger pipeline operational and ready for observability integration.  

**Config Compliance (Task 1.5 ‚Üí Subtask 1.2):**
- Renamed `next.config.js` ‚Üí `next.config.mjs` to satisfy ESM import enforcement.
- Removed all `require()` usage to comply with `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports`.
- Verified ESLint clean run and Next.js configuration load.

### üß© Reflection Entry ‚Äî Task 1.5 ‚Üí Subtask 1.2  
**Scope:** Sentry + LogRocket Integration / ESLint Flat Config Stabilization  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.1.5-observability-docs  
**Baseline:** v0.1.9  
**Date:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

#### Summary
Completed full migration to ESLint 9 Flat Config architecture with unified TypeScript + JSX parsing.  
All static analysis layers (Next.js 15, Node, Browser, Prettier, and Jest contexts) validated cleanly.

#### Actions Performed
- Created `tsconfig.eslint.json` to consolidate linting scope.  
- Removed deprecated `env` keys; replaced with `languageOptions.globals`.  
- Added backend and Playwright overrides for Node-based configs.  
- Ensured Prettier enforcement and automatic formatting parity.  
- Verified `pnpm lint` passes with 0 errors / 0 warnings.  

#### Validation Outcome
‚úÖ Static codebase quality verified.  
‚úÖ Cross-context parsing (TSX + Jest + Node) passes.  
‚úÖ Covenant Atomic Commit Discipline upheld.
