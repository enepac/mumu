## Reflection ‚Äî v0.1.4 Observability & Guardrails

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Engineer:** Enrico Acha  
**Focus:** Stability validation, observability wiring, backend discipline.

### Insights
- Integrating observability early dramatically improves operational trust.
- Fly.io health checks exposed real gaps in environment variable management ‚Äî resolved by codifying `.env` discipline and runtime fallbacks.
- The `atomic commit` principle continues to protect stability; the system remains reproducible and revertible at every baseline.

### Lessons
- Future instrumentation (Grafana, Supabase logs) should flow through the same observability layer (not direct DB polling).
- Covenant enforcement ensured the sequence stayed linear ‚Äî no enhancement drift occurred.
- We confirmed our guardrail foundation before extending to testing and telemetry (v0.1.5 ‚Üí v0.1.7).

### Next Direction
Proceed to:
- v0.1.5 ‚Üí Add Jest + Playwright with coverage and CI validation.
- v0.1.6 ‚Üí Integrate Dependabot + CodeQL.
- v0.1.7 ‚Üí Extend telemetry pipeline to Grafana Cloud & Supabase logs.

## [Part 1 ‚Üí Task 1.4] Configure Jest + Playwright Tests with Coverage Reports
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Executor:** suberu  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.1.4-observability-guardrails  
**Summary:**
- Installed `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`, `@babel/preset-react`, and `ts-node`.  
- Created `/jest.config.ts` to run unit tests only and isolate Playwright E2E tests.  
- Added Babel presets for React (JSX) and TypeScript transformation.  
- Verified sample Jest test passes and coverage report generated under `/coverage/`.  
- Confirmed CI compatibility; global coverage gate temporarily relaxed per Covenant Phase 1 criteria.  

**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ Test pipeline operational; Playwright and Jest separated; coverage reports functional; ready for baseline v0.1.5.  

## [Part 1 ‚Üí Task 1.4 ‚Äì Dependabot + CodeQL Guardrails]
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Summary:**  
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly dependency updates.  
- Added `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` for automated vulnerability scanning.  
**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ Security & supply-chain guardrails active. Ready for baseline v0.1.6.

**Baseline Adjustment:**  
Previous baseline/v0.1.6 existed. Created new tag baseline/v0.1.7 to preserve immutability and record final validation of Dependabot + CodeQL guardrails.

**Branch Transition ‚Äî Initiation of Task 1.5**
- From: enhancement/v0.1.4-observability-guardrails  
- To: enhancement/v0.1.5-observability-docs  
- Based On: baseline/v0.1.7a  
- Purpose: Begin Part 1 ‚Üí Task 1.5 (Observability & Documentation)  
- Status: Clean working tree; dependency locks committed before transition.

**Dependency Substitution (Task 1.5 ‚Üí Subtask 1):**
Unable to reach npm registry for @logrocket/browser due to network or regional block.
Replaced with unscoped `logrocket` package (identical API). Verified installation integrity and API compatibility.

## [Part 1 ‚Üí Task 1.5 ‚Üí Subtask 1.1] Pino Structured Logger Setup
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Executor:** suberu  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.1.5-observability-docs  
**Summary:**

## [Reflection] Task 2.1 ‚Äî Subtask 1 (API Orchestration Layer & Observability Baseline)
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.2.0-backend-platform  
**Tag:** baseline/backend-v0.2.1  

### Validation Summary
- Next.js API routes compiled and served (`/api/health`, `/api/session`, `/api/ask`).
- Sentry instrumentation initialized cleanly via public API (`@sentry/nextjs`).
- No TypeScript or linting errors.
- No ‚Äúintermediate value‚Äù or ESM/CommonJS interop conflicts.
- Runtime verified: `next dev` launches successfully with observability hooks active.

### Reflection
This subtask establishes the operational backbone for Mumu‚Äôs backend platform under Covenant rules ‚Äî stable observability, atomic baseline, validated routes. System integrity confirmed for escalation to heavy-processing orchestration.

## [Reflection] Task 2.1 ‚Äî API Orchestration Layer (Vercel)
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Branch:** enhancement/v0.2.0-backend-platform  
**Baseline Tag:** baseline/backend-v0.2.1  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Validated and Baselined  

---

### üîç Issue 1 ‚Äî TypeScript ESM Interop Failure
**Error Message:**  
`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and `Unknown file extension ".ts"` when running `ts-node` or `node --loader ts-node/esm`.

**Root Cause:**  
Node 22 + Next 15 required proper ESM interop, but `tsconfig.json` lacked correct `moduleResolution` and `esModuleInterop` alignment with Next.js‚Äôs build pipeline.

**Fix Applied:**  
- Updated `tsconfig.json` with `"module": "esnext"` and `"esModuleInterop": true`.  
- Switched execution to `pnpm exec next dev` for environment-consistent execution.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Treat Next.js as the entry point for TypeScript execution ‚Äî avoid direct `node` imports of TS modules outside Next‚Äôs runtime.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Issue 2 ‚Äî Pino Logger Interop Error
**Error Message:**  
`Module ... can only be default-imported using the 'esModuleInterop' flag.`

**Root Cause:**  
`pino` uses `export = pino;`, which breaks with ES imports unless `esModuleInterop` is enabled.

**Fix Applied:**  
Enabled `"esModuleInterop": true` in `tsconfig.json`.  
Recompiled logger using:  
`pnpm tsc src/lib/logger.ts --module commonjs --esModuleInterop --outDir dist`.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Legacy CommonJS modules require explicit interop flags for type safety and runtime consistency.

---

### üß© Issue 3 ‚Äî ESLint 9 Flat-Config Migration Errors
**Error Messages:**  
- ‚Äúplugins key must be an object‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúA configuration object is using the env key‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúCould not find plugin prettier‚Äù  

**Root Cause:**  
Migration to ESLint 9 (flat-config system) incompatible with old `.eslintrc`.  
Plugins like Prettier and TypeScript had to be imported as objects instead of string arrays.

**Fix Applied:**  
Created `eslint.config.mjs` with:
- `import js from "@eslint/js"`  
- Explicit `plugins: { "@typescript-eslint": plugin, prettier: plugin }`  
- Added `prettierConfig` last for conflict resolution.  

**Lesson Learned:**  
ESLint v9+ requires fully object-based plugin definitions; compat layers must be removed for reliability.

---

### üß† Issue 4 ‚Äî Next.js Config Key Misuse (`sentry` Field)
**Error Message:**  
`Invalid next.config.mjs options detected: Unrecognized key(s): 'sentry'`

**Root Cause:**  
Sentry v10.18 with Next 15 no longer accepts a top-level `sentry:` config object.  
Integration must wrap the entire Next config via `withSentryConfig()`.

**Fix Applied:**  
Rewrote `next.config.mjs` to:  
```js
import { withSentryConfig } from "@sentry/nextjs";
export default withSentryConfig(moduleExports, sentryWebpackPluginOptions);

Lesson Learned:
Always delegate plugin configuration through official wrappers to avoid schema drift as Next.js evolves.

üß∞ Issue 5 ‚Äî Instrumentation Hook Failures

Symptoms & Errors:

browserTracingIntegration is not a function

getCurrentHub is not a function

Type 'BrowserTracing' is not assignable to type 'Integration'

Root Cause:
API surface changes between @sentry/browser, @sentry/tracing, and @sentry/nextjs v10.x.
Incorrect imports from deprecated paths caused type and runtime conflicts.

Fix Applied:

Removed deprecated packages (@sentry/browser, @sentry/tracing).

Used only @sentry/nextjs for both server and client.

Rewrote src/instrumentation.ts to call Sentry.init({ dsn, tracesSampleRate, integrations: [ Sentry.captureConsoleIntegration() ] }).

Validated via pnpm exec tsc --noEmit ‚Üí no errors.

Lesson Learned:
For Next.js 15+, all Sentry features (client and server) are unified under @sentry/nextjs; mixing old modules breaks integration.

ü™µ Issue 6 ‚Äî OpenTelemetry Warnings

Warning Message:
Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression

Root Cause:
This is a known benign warning from OpenTelemetry‚Äôs dynamic loader inside Sentry‚Äôs OTEL integration.

Fix Applied:
None required; documented and suppressed for CI/CD noise control.

Lesson Learned:
Not all warnings require patches ‚Äî some are safe runtime artifacts from instrumentation libraries.

üß© Issue 7 ‚Äî Build Failure TypeError: ((intermediate value) || []) is not iterable

Root Cause:
Misplaced spread syntax in next.config.mjs during Sentry config merging.

Fix Applied:
Converted next.config.mjs to CommonJS (next.config.cjs) with explicit module.exports = withSentryConfig(...).

Lesson Learned:
Next.js 15 ESM interop is still sensitive; CommonJS remains the safest approach for plugin composition.

üß© Issue 8 ‚Äî Line-Ending Warnings

Message:
CRLF will be replaced by LF the next time Git touches it

Root Cause:
Windows environment saving files with CRLF; Git auto-normalizing to LF.

Fix Applied:
No action needed ‚Äî accepted Git‚Äôs auto-conversion.
Optional setting git config core.autocrlf true documented for developer machines.

Lesson Learned:
Normalize line endings to LF for cross-platform consistency.

üß≠ Final Validation

‚úÖ pnpm exec tsc --noEmit ‚Üí no type errors
‚úÖ pnpm lint ‚Üí clean
‚úÖ pnpm build ‚Üí succeeded with expected OTEL warnings
‚úÖ pnpm dev ‚Üí API routes active and observability operational

üìò Key Takeaways

-Favor modular CJS configs for mixed plugin systems (Sentry + Next).
-Centralize observability under one package to avoid version drift.
-Track every fix in reflection logs for Covenant audit traceability.
-Maintain LF line endings and atomic commit discipline for all baselines.

## [Task 2.2 ‚Üí Subtask 2.2.1]
Validated Whisper GPU container build and deployment on Fly.io.
Fixed build-context, TypeScript type declarations, and runtime binding.
/health endpoint responds with 200 OK.
Outcome: ‚úÖ Whisper GPU container operational.
Baseline: backend-v0.2.2a.

Reflection Log ‚Äî Part 2 ‚Üí Task 2.2 ‚Üí Subtask 2.2.1 (Whisper GPU Container Development)

1. Error: Fly.io build context failures ("failed to calculate checksum of ref ... '/shared': not found")
   Root Cause: The initial fly.toml used local build contexts ("./" or "../"), which prevented Docker from seeing directories outside the containers/whisper folder. Fly.io only includes files within the specified context during deployment.
   Fix: Moved fly.whisper.toml to /backend, set build_context = ".", and updated all COPY commands to use backend/... paths.
   Lesson: Fly.io requires the build_context to include all necessary subdirectories; explicit relative paths ensure deterministic builds.

2. Error: Express server not reachable ‚Äì Fly warning "app is not listening on expected address"
   Root Cause: Express app.listen() was bound only to port, which defaults to localhost (127.0.0.1). Fly machines expect services to listen on 0.0.0.0:8080.
   Fix: Updated server code to listen on 0.0.0.0.
   Lesson: Always bind to 0.0.0.0 in containerized environments to expose the service externally.

3. Error: Cannot find module '/app/containers/whisper/server.js'
   Root Cause: Docker attempted to run server.js, but only the TypeScript source (server.ts) existed; no build step was compiling to JavaScript inside the container.
   Fix: Added a TypeScript build step using "pnpm exec tsc -p backend/tsconfig.json" and changed CMD to run the compiled file in dist/.
   Lesson: Containers running TypeScript code must include an explicit build step before runtime.

4. Error: TypeScript compiler ‚Äì "No inputs were found in config file ..."
   Root Cause: backend/tsconfig.json excluded container and shared directories, so tsc found no files to compile.
   Fix: Expanded the include paths in tsconfig.json to include index.ts, src/**/*.ts, containers/**/*.ts, and shared/**/*.ts.
   Lesson: Keep tsconfig inclusion paths synchronized with actual repository structure to ensure all files are compiled.

5. Error: TypeScript build failure ‚Äì missing type declarations
   Root Cause: @types packages (@types/node, @types/express, @types/cors) were not installed during the Docker build. The compiler could not find declaration files for Node and Express.
   Fix: Installed required type declarations using "pnpm add -D @types/node @types/express @types/cors" before running tsc.
   Lesson: When compiling inside containers, include type declaration packages even if they are dev-only dependencies.

6. Validation Outcome:
   After all fixes, the container deployed successfully. Logs showed "Whisper container listening on 0.0.0.0:8080".
   curl [https://mumu-whisper.fly.dev/health](https://mumu-whisper.fly.dev/health) returned {"status":"healthy","uptime":1.232,"version":"v0.2.2a"}.

Result: Whisper GPU container validated and reachable through Fly.io.

Key Takeaways:

* Align Fly.io build_context with repository boundaries.
* Always expose services on 0.0.0.0:PORT.
* Include both source and type declaration files in TypeScript builds.
* Record each debugging step to preserve reproducibility and covenant traceability.

### Reflection ‚Äî Subtask 2.2.2b  
Deployment of LLM Orchestrator container (`mumu-orchestrator`) completed successfully.  
Encountered module-type mismatch and invalid Fastify logger config; resolved by aligning `package.json` to CommonJS and switching to proper Fastify logger object configuration.  
Health endpoint confirmed active with proper uptime telemetry.  
System integrity validated.

### Reflection ‚Äî Subtask 2.2.2b (Fly.io Orchestrator Deployment)

**Timeline Summary**

Subtask 2.2.2b encompassed the full lifecycle of deploying the Mumu Orchestrator container (`mumu-orchestrator`) on Fly.io.  
The process began from a working branch `enhancement/v0.2.0-backend-platform` and followed covenant-aligned discipline for deterministic backend deployment.

---

**Key Development Stages**

1. **Initial Preparation**
   - Created container directory: `backend/containers/orchestrator/`.
   - Added base Dockerfile referencing Node 22-slim image.
   - Verified local TypeScript compilation and orchestrator Fastify routes.
   - Installed dependencies:  
     `pnpm add fastify pino @sentry/node bullmq cors dotenv express ioredis prom-client @supabase/supabase-js`.

2. **Dependency Resolution & Type Fixes**
   - Encountered missing types: `Cannot find name 'process'` and `Cannot find module 'os'`.
   - Resolved by installing build-time types:  
     `pnpm add -D @types/node typescript`.
   - Added lightweight `tsconfig.json` for container compilation.

3. **ESLint Validation**
   - Ran `pnpm lint --fix` after adding `globals` dependency to repair ESLint‚Äôs node global definitions.
   - Lint executed successfully with no remaining warnings.

4. **Initial Deployment Attempts**
   - Attempted `fly launch --name mumu-orchestrator --vm-gpus 1 --vm-gpu-kind a10`.
   - Received error: `unknown flag: --vm-gpu-count`; corrected to use `--vm-gpus`.
   - First `fly deploy` failed because Dockerfile referenced nonexistent relative paths:
     ```
     COPY ../../package.json ../../pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
     ```
     Corrected by adjusting build context to use local `package.json` only.

5. **Subsequent Failures and Resolutions**
   - **Error 1:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/package.json'`  
     ‚Üí Fixed path references in Dockerfile.
   - **Error 2:** `The specified path does not exist: tsconfig.json`  
     ‚Üí Added dedicated `tsconfig.json` in orchestrator folder.
   - **Error 3:** Missing `@types/node` within build image.  
     ‚Üí Added to Dockerfile install step:  
       `RUN npm install --omit=dev typescript @types/node`.
   - **Error 4:** Application failed with  
     `ReferenceError: exports is not defined in ES module scope`.  
     ‚Üí Root cause: `"type": "module"` in root package.json combined with CommonJS output.  
     ‚Üí Standardized build to CommonJS for container context.

6. **Runtime Logger Configuration Failure**
   - Once CommonJS alignment resolved, container reached runtime but crashed on:
     ```
     FastifyError [Error]: logger options only accepts a configuration object.
     ```
   - Investigated and determined the root cause: `Fastify({ logger })` passed a Pino instance instead of a configuration object.
   - Fixed code:
     ```ts
     const app = Fastify({
       logger: {
         level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || "info",
         transport: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? undefined : { target: "pino-pretty" },
       },
     });
     ```

7. **Successful Deployment**
   - After correction, redeployed container:
     ```
     fly deploy -c fly.toml
     ```
   - Deployment logs confirmed healthy build:
     ```
     ‚úì Configuration is valid
     image size: 84 MB
     Visit https://mumu-orchestrator.fly.dev/
     ```
   - Health endpoint validated:
     ```bash
     curl -s https://mumu-orchestrator.fly.dev/health
     ```
     ‚Üí Response:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "ok",
       "version": "dev",
       "uptime": 0.615072103,
       "memory": { "rss": 63774720, "heapUsed": 10223456 },
       "hostname": "91850e41f77e38"
     }
     ```

---

**Final Reflection**

The orchestrator now serves as the live backend executor for multi-step LLM pipelines.  
The build encountered multiple realistic cloud deployment conditions‚Äîinvalid Docker paths, Node module resolution, ESM/CJS boundary mismatches, and runtime logger misconfiguration‚Äîall of which were resolved sequentially and documented.  
The result is a healthy, reproducible Fly.io service baseline (GPU A10).

**Validated:** October 9 2025  
**Engineer:** Suberu  
**Environment:** Fly.io GPU A10  
**Status:** Healthy

[2025-10-09] Subtask 2.2.3 ‚Äî Orchestrator Autoscaling and Metrics (Full Timeline)

Context:
Scope: backend/containers/orchestrator
Objective: production-grade Fly.io deploy with health, Prometheus metrics, and autoscaling verified.
Baseline tag: baseline/backend-v0.2.2.3

Phase A ‚Äî Initial Build and Deploy
Ran command: fly deploy -c backend/containers/orchestrator/fly.toml --remote-only
Result: Build finished and image pushed. On first boot, app crashed immediately with error:
FastifyError: logger options only accepts a configuration object.
Code: FST_ERR_LOG_INVALID_LOGGER_CONFIG
Root cause: Fastify v5 expects logger to be a config object, not a pre-instantiated pino instance.
Fix: Rewrote logger initialization to pass a config object, using pino-pretty only in non-production mode. Rebuilt and redeployed. Application started successfully.

Phase B ‚Äî Local Compilation and Verification
Installed required dependencies with pnpm add fastify prom-client pino and pnpm add -D typescript @types/node pino-pretty
Compiled locally using pnpm exec tsc --project tsconfig.json
Ran node dist/orchestrator.js
Initial failure due to missing pino-pretty transport target. Installed pino-pretty as a dev dependency. After installation, local run succeeded and Fastify logged:
Server listening at [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
Server listening at multiple interfaces
Orchestrator running on port 8080
Verification with curl [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health) returned status ok JSON payload.
Verification with curl [http://localhost:8080/metrics](http://localhost:8080/metrics) returned valid Prometheus metrics including nodejs, process, and custom histogram data.

Phase C ‚Äî Docker Build and Environment Challenges
First build attempt failed during npx tsc with message: ‚ÄúThis is not the tsc command you are looking for.‚Äù
Cause: typescript was missing in the runtime image because only production dependencies were installed.
Fix: Introduced a multi-stage Docker build with two stages: builder and runtime.
Builder installs dev dependencies and compiles to dist.
Runtime installs production dependencies using npm install --omit=dev --ignore-scripts to skip husky prepare hooks, which had previously caused failures.
Ensured that tsconfig.json and package.json were copied before npm install to make TypeScript available.
Also confirmed source files were copied before running npx tsc to ensure dist directory existed.
Verified locally that pnpm exec tsc produced dist/orchestrator.js, health.js, metrics.js, pipeline.js, and utils.js.

Encountered additional error during runtime install: husky not found.
Resolved by ignoring postinstall scripts with --ignore-scripts.

Second major issue: Fly remote build failing with ‚Äúarchive/tar: unknown file mode ?rwxr-xr-x‚Äù.
Root cause: Windows file metadata leaking into build context during compression.
Resolution: Created a root-level file named .mumu-dockerignore containing:
**
!backend/containers/orchestrator/**
This limited the Docker build context strictly to orchestrator subdirectory and eliminated problematic Windows file metadata.
All infrastructure files (Dockerfile, fly.toml, and .mumu-dockerignore) were saved as UTF-8 with LF line endings to avoid carriage return issues.
This completely resolved tar mode errors on Fly builder.

Final image built successfully with multi-stage setup.
Image size approximately 77 MB.

Phase D ‚Äî Deployment Validation
Deployed successfully to Fly.io.
Health endpoint check:
curl [https://mumu-orchestrator.fly.dev/health](https://mumu-orchestrator.fly.dev/health)
returned status ok with hostname, uptime, and memory details.
Metrics endpoint check:
curl [https://mumu-orchestrator.fly.dev/metrics](https://mumu-orchestrator.fly.dev/metrics)
returned valid Prometheus metrics including process_cpu_seconds_total, nodejs_heap, garbage collection durations, and custom histogram mumu_pipeline_duration_seconds.
Node.js version reported remotely as v22.20.0.

Logs from Fly:
Server listening at [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
Server listening at [http://172.19.3.242:8080](http://172.19.3.242:8080)
Server listening at [http://172.19.3.243:8080](http://172.19.3.243:8080)
Orchestrator running on port 8080
Health check on port 8080 is now passing.

Phase E ‚Äî Autoscaling Validation
Scaled application to 2 machines using fly scale count 2 -a mumu-orchestrator
Output confirmed creation of new machine 178175e0f20358 in region sjc.
fly scale show reported 2 machines running, shared-cpu-1x size, 256MB memory each.
Observed Fly autostop event: App has excess capacity, autostopping machine 178175e0f20358. 1 out of 2 machines left running.
Conclusion: autoscaling and autostop verified functioning correctly.

Phase F ‚Äî File Encoding Hygiene
Verified all infrastructure files were encoded as UTF-8 and used LF line endings.
Ensured Visual Studio Code settings had End of Line: LF to maintain consistency.
This prevented recurrence of tar file mode errors and ensured clean remote builds.

Final State
Health and metrics endpoints working both locally and remotely.
Autoscaling functioning with min 1, max 3.
Validated baseline captured as baseline/backend-v0.2.2.3
Build ID registry.fly.io/mumu-orchestrator:deployment-01K75PDX45AG57WEFENRM41K31
Image size 77 MB.
Region sjc.
Machines running: 2 shared-cpu-1x (256 MB each).

Key Console Snapshots
Remote health output: {"status":"ok","version":"dev","uptime":131.8797,"hostname":"91850e41f77e38"}
Remote metrics sample included process_resident_memory_bytes, nodejs_version_info, and custom histograms.

Lessons Learned
Fastify logger must use configuration object rather than instantiated pino.
Multi-stage builds isolate development and runtime dependencies efficiently.
Using --ignore-scripts prevents husky postinstall errors in production images.
Scoped build context via .mumu-dockerignore eliminates Windows tar mode errors.
UTF-8 encoding with LF endings must be enforced for consistent remote builds.

This marks completion of Subtask 2.2.3 under Part 2.2 Backend Platform, with the orchestrator container stabilized, autoscaling verified, and metrics operational in production.
