## Decision: Immutable Baseline v0.1
- Baseline v0.1 tagged after completion of Task 1.1 (Tech Stack & Repo Initialization).
- Rollback drill executed and validated.
- Covenant: all future baselines must be rollback-tested before acceptance.
- Immutable principle adopted: no force-push or history rewrite allowed on baseline tags.
