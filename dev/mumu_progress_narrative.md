# MUMU PROGRESS NARRATIVE
# Covenant-Governed Development Chronicle
# Version 1.0 — Compiled October 2025

---

## PREFACE

This document serves as the high-level chronological narrative of the Mumu system.  
While `/dev/_reflection.md` captures raw debugging intelligence and `/dev/_decisions.md` stores architectural rationale,  
this narrative translates those detailed records into a unified storyline of how Mumu evolved baseline by baseline.

Each phase entry below corresponds to a validated baseline tag under Covenant Atomic Commit Discipline (§3).  
All summaries are verified through Decision Log v3 and Reflection Log concordance.

## PART 0 — FOUNDATIONS (v0.1.0 → v0.1.1)
**Date:** Late September 2025  
**Objective:** Establish Covenant Strict Mode and engineering ground truth.

- Activated the Mumu Development Covenant and Covenant Enforcement Instruction.
- Bound GPT into Covenant Strict Mode (accuracy-first, atomic commits, immutable baselines).
- Created core development guardrails: ESLint Flat Config, Prettier, Commitizen, Husky, Lint-Staged.
- Scaffolded frontend (Next.js 15) and backend (Node 22 + Express + TypeScript).
- Linked Supabase for persistence; achieved “Hello World” connectivity.

**Baseline:** `baseline/v0.1.1`  
**Outcome:** Initial covenant environment validated; reproducible commit discipline confirmed.

---

## PART 1 — INFRASTRUCTURE & GUARDRAILS (v0.1.2 → v0.1.4)
**Objective:** Harden environment and enable observability.

- Implemented CI/CD via GitHub Actions with full lint + build + test gates.
- Integrated Sentry, Pino, and LogRocket for observability.
- Validated Fly.io deployment pipeline for backend services.
- Completed first rollback drill to confirm baseline immutability.

**Baseline:** `baseline/v0.1.4`  
**Outcome:** Stable development and deployment pipeline; observability framework active.

---

## PART 1.5 — SECURITY & TESTING (v0.1.5 → v0.1.12)
**Objective:** Complete environment hardening and documentation synthesis.

- Added Jest + Playwright testing suites with coverage reporting.
- Enabled Dependabot and CodeQL for continuous security scanning.
- Finalized documentation of Covenant directives and guardrails.
- Confirmed local ↔ Codespaces parity for reproducibility.

**Baseline:** `baseline/v0.1.12`  
**Outcome:** System secured and fully documented; governance pipeline complete.

---

## PART 2 — BACKEND PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT

### TASK 2.1 — API ORCHESTRATION LAYER (Vercel)
**Baseline:** `backend-v0.2.1`  
**Objective:** Create thin API layer for session orchestration.

- Scaffolded `/api/health`, `/api/session`, `/api/ask` endpoints.
- Integrated structured JSON logging with Sentry + Pino.
- Validated orchestration routes and health endpoint via Vercel deployment.

**Result:** API orchestration operational and Covenant-validated.

---

### TASK 2.2 — HEAVY PROCESSING CONTAINERS (Fly.io)

#### Subtask 2.2.1 — Whisper GPU Container
**Baseline:** `backend-v0.2.2a`  
**Objective:** Deploy GPU-enabled Whisper fallback container.

**Major Events:**
- Designed Dockerfile.gpu using CUDA 12.1.1 + Node 22 + pnpm.
- Created Fly.io deployment script `scripts/deploy_fly.sh`.
- Resolved multiple build errors (context visibility, tsconfig inclusion, missing @types packages).
- Deployed container successfully on Fly.io; verified `/health` endpoint.
- Logged reflection entries for every issue with root cause and key lessons.

**Result:** Whisper container operational, responding to external health checks.

**Reflection Summary:**
- Context misalignment, binding errors, and compiler misconfiguration sequentially resolved.
- Outcome validated through covenant testing discipline.

**Key Lesson:** Deterministic container builds require explicit context scope, type inclusion, and post-build validation.

## SYNTHESIS

The Mumu project has transitioned from an experimental repository into a covenant-governed AI engineering platform.  
It now operates under immutable baselines, enforcing accuracy, observability, and atomic change tracking.  
Every component — from code to process — is synchronized under Covenant law, ensuring reproducible evolution.  

Mumu’s architecture now combines:
- Vercel for lightweight API orchestration.
- Fly.io for GPU-enabled heavy processing.
- Supabase for persistence and secure data access.
- Covenant-based governance for process integrity.

Next milestones focus on completing the orchestration layer (LLM container), persistence security (RLS + AES), and full backend validation (`baseline/backend-v0.3.0`).

#### Narrative Progress — Part 2 → Task 2.2 → Subtask 2.2.2b

The backend orchestration system advanced into production-grade deployment.  
This milestone transitioned the Orchestrator from a local Fastify mock service into a cloud-native container operating on Fly.io GPU infrastructure.

The process reflected a true “flight-black-box” deployment pattern:
- Multiple container build retries with detailed Docker and Node runtime telemetry.
- Stepwise error identification, correction, and redeployment cycles.
- Validation via live HTTP `/health` endpoint confirming operational stability.

**Technical Milestones**
- Node 22 slim base image confirmed minimal footprint (84 MB).
- Added TypeScript, Fastify, and telemetry dependencies inline.
- Resolved ESM-to-CommonJS mismatch through deterministic configuration.
- Established logging discipline using Fastify’s built-in Pino transport.
- Final build and deployment validated via Fly.io console and external `curl`.

**Flight Telemetry Snapshot**
{"status":"ok","version":"dev","uptime":0.615072103,"hostname":"91850e41f77e38"}


The orchestrator now stands as the operational anchor for backend pipeline orchestration—ready to integrate autoscaling policies and metrics collection in Subtask 2.2.3.

### [2025-10-09] Orchestrator: From Crash to Baseline with Autoscaling & Metrics

We began with a seemingly healthy image but a runtime crash: Fastify rejected a `pino` instance passed as `logger`. Converting that to a Fastify `logger` config, and scoping pretty logs to non-prod, stabilized boot.

Next, TypeScript compilation inside the container failed because `npx tsc` was invoked without `typescript` installed. We introduced a multi-stage Docker build: the builder installs dev deps and compiles to `dist/`, while the runtime installs production deps with `--ignore-scripts` to bypass husky. We ensured `tsconfig.json` and sources were present *before* running `tsc` to prevent missing `dist/`.

Fly’s remote builder raised `archive/tar: unknown file mode ?rwxr-xr-x`—a Windows artifact. We fixed this by constraining build context with a root `.mumu-dockerignore` to only include the orchestrator subtree, and we confirmed UTF-8 + LF in Dockerfile, Fly config, and ignore files.

With local smoke tests (`/health`, `/metrics`) passing, we redeployed. Health checks went green, metrics exposed expected node/process families and our pipeline histogram. We scaled to 2 machines to verify redundancy and observed autostop under low load. Finally, we tagged the stable state as `baseline/backend-v0.2.2.3`.

The key takeaways: use Fastify’s logger correctly, favor multi-stage builds, disable scripts in runtime, isolate build context on Windows, and enforce line endings. The result is a small image, fast startup, and production-grade observability.

#### Phase 0 — Provision Validation Gate (backend-v0.2.3-p0)
Doppler was authenticated and scoped to the Mumu project directory.  
Secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ANON_KEY`) were fetched successfully via CLI, confirming end-to-end secret management integrity.  
This phase establishes a secure foundation for database provisioning and schema migration in Subtask 2.3.1.  
System health status: ✅ Stable. Baseline tagged as `backend-v0.2.3-p0`.

#### Subtask 2.3.1 — Supabase Project Provisioning (backend-v0.2.3-a)
Supabase CLI authenticated and linked to project `gjrxxiblykxtgmfwnjbp`. A manual `.supabase/config.toml` was anchored to enforce local linkage. Connectivity tests confirmed the remote database is accessible and ready for schema migration. This marks the foundation for Covenant-secured persistence development.

#### Subtask 2.3.2 — Core Schema Definitions (backend-v0.2.3-b)
Mumu’s backend persistence layer reached its first complete data model.  
All core tables were defined and verified through Supabase Cloud connectivity.  
Running `supabase db pull` produced the remote schema snapshot, confirming a synchronized, secure database foundation.  
System health: ✅ Stable · Baseline `backend-v0.2.3-b` tagged.

#### Subtask 2.3.3 — Row-Level Security (RLS) & Policies (backend-v0.2.3-c)
After final SQL enforcement, RLS is active on all workspace-scoped tables.  
This ensures strict tenant isolation across data and prepares the system for encryption-level security in the next phase.  
System Health: ✅ Stable · Baseline backend-v0.2.3-c tagged.

#### Subtask 2.3.4 — AES-256 Encryption (backend-v0.2.3-d)
Mumu backend achieved runtime encryption compliance.  
Application-layer AES-256-GCM encryption verified operational via /api/ask test.  
This closes the persistence security foundation: Supabase (RLS) + AES-256 (app-level) + Doppler (key isolation).  
System Health: ✅ Stable · Baseline backend-v0.2.3-d tagged.
