# MUMU PROGRESS NARRATIVE
# Covenant-Governed Development Chronicle
# Version 1.0 — Compiled October 2025

---

## PREFACE

This document serves as the high-level chronological narrative of the Mumu system.  
While `/dev/_reflection.md` captures raw debugging intelligence and `/dev/_decisions.md` stores architectural rationale,  
this narrative translates those detailed records into a unified storyline of how Mumu evolved baseline by baseline.

Each phase entry below corresponds to a validated baseline tag under Covenant Atomic Commit Discipline (§3).  
All summaries are verified through Decision Log v3 and Reflection Log concordance.

## PART 0 — FOUNDATIONS (v0.1.0 → v0.1.1)
**Date:** Late September 2025  
**Objective:** Establish Covenant Strict Mode and engineering ground truth.

- Activated the Mumu Development Covenant and Covenant Enforcement Instruction.
- Bound GPT into Covenant Strict Mode (accuracy-first, atomic commits, immutable baselines).
- Created core development guardrails: ESLint Flat Config, Prettier, Commitizen, Husky, Lint-Staged.
- Scaffolded frontend (Next.js 15) and backend (Node 22 + Express + TypeScript).
- Linked Supabase for persistence; achieved “Hello World” connectivity.

**Baseline:** `baseline/v0.1.1`  
**Outcome:** Initial covenant environment validated; reproducible commit discipline confirmed.

---

## PART 1 — INFRASTRUCTURE & GUARDRAILS (v0.1.2 → v0.1.4)
**Objective:** Harden environment and enable observability.

- Implemented CI/CD via GitHub Actions with full lint + build + test gates.
- Integrated Sentry, Pino, and LogRocket for observability.
- Validated Fly.io deployment pipeline for backend services.
- Completed first rollback drill to confirm baseline immutability.

**Baseline:** `baseline/v0.1.4`  
**Outcome:** Stable development and deployment pipeline; observability framework active.

---

## PART 1.5 — SECURITY & TESTING (v0.1.5 → v0.1.12)
**Objective:** Complete environment hardening and documentation synthesis.

- Added Jest + Playwright testing suites with coverage reporting.
- Enabled Dependabot and CodeQL for continuous security scanning.
- Finalized documentation of Covenant directives and guardrails.
- Confirmed local ↔ Codespaces parity for reproducibility.

**Baseline:** `baseline/v0.1.12`  
**Outcome:** System secured and fully documented; governance pipeline complete.

---

## PART 2 — BACKEND PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT

### TASK 2.1 — API ORCHESTRATION LAYER (Vercel)
**Baseline:** `backend-v0.2.1`  
**Objective:** Create thin API layer for session orchestration.

- Scaffolded `/api/health`, `/api/session`, `/api/ask` endpoints.
- Integrated structured JSON logging with Sentry + Pino.
- Validated orchestration routes and health endpoint via Vercel deployment.

**Result:** API orchestration operational and Covenant-validated.

---

### TASK 2.2 — HEAVY PROCESSING CONTAINERS (Fly.io)

#### Subtask 2.2.1 — Whisper GPU Container
**Baseline:** `backend-v0.2.2a`  
**Objective:** Deploy GPU-enabled Whisper fallback container.

**Major Events:**
- Designed Dockerfile.gpu using CUDA 12.1.1 + Node 22 + pnpm.
- Created Fly.io deployment script `scripts/deploy_fly.sh`.
- Resolved multiple build errors (context visibility, tsconfig inclusion, missing @types packages).
- Deployed container successfully on Fly.io; verified `/health` endpoint.
- Logged reflection entries for every issue with root cause and key lessons.

**Result:** Whisper container operational, responding to external health checks.

**Reflection Summary:**
- Context misalignment, binding errors, and compiler misconfiguration sequentially resolved.
- Outcome validated through covenant testing discipline.

**Key Lesson:** Deterministic container builds require explicit context scope, type inclusion, and post-build validation.

---

## CURRENT STATE (as of October 9, 2025)
- Covenant Strict Mode and Precision Synthesis Covenant fully active.
- Observability and logging stack unified (Sentry + Pino + LogRocket).
- Whisper GPU container deployed and healthy.
- API orchestration layer (Vercel) operational.
- Supabase persistence schema pending RLS/AES configuration (Task 2.3 next).
- Redis queues and orchestrator container scheduled for implementation (Task 2.2.2b / 2.4).

**System Health:** Stable  
**Active Baselines:**  
- v0.1.1 — Foundations  
- v0.1.4 — Guardrails  
- v0.1.12 — Security & Documentation  
- backend-v0.2.1 — API Orchestration  
- backend-v0.2.2a — Whisper GPU

## SYNTHESIS

The Mumu project has transitioned from an experimental repository into a covenant-governed AI engineering platform.  
It now operates under immutable baselines, enforcing accuracy, observability, and atomic change tracking.  
Every component — from code to process — is synchronized under Covenant law, ensuring reproducible evolution.  

Mumu’s architecture now combines:
- Vercel for lightweight API orchestration.
- Fly.io for GPU-enabled heavy processing.
- Supabase for persistence and secure data access.
- Covenant-based governance for process integrity.

Next milestones focus on completing the orchestration layer (LLM container), persistence security (RLS + AES), and full backend validation (`baseline/backend-v0.3.0`).

#### Narrative Progress — Part 2 → Task 2.2 → Subtask 2.2.2b

The backend orchestration system advanced into production-grade deployment.  
This milestone transitioned the Orchestrator from a local Fastify mock service into a cloud-native container operating on Fly.io GPU infrastructure.

The process reflected a true “flight-black-box” deployment pattern:
- Multiple container build retries with detailed Docker and Node runtime telemetry.
- Stepwise error identification, correction, and redeployment cycles.
- Validation via live HTTP `/health` endpoint confirming operational stability.

**Technical Milestones**
- Node 22 slim base image confirmed minimal footprint (84 MB).
- Added TypeScript, Fastify, and telemetry dependencies inline.
- Resolved ESM-to-CommonJS mismatch through deterministic configuration.
- Established logging discipline using Fastify’s built-in Pino transport.
- Final build and deployment validated via Fly.io console and external `curl`.

**Flight Telemetry Snapshot**
{"status":"ok","version":"dev","uptime":0.615072103,"hostname":"91850e41f77e38"}


The orchestrator now stands as the operational anchor for backend pipeline orchestration—ready to integrate autoscaling policies and metrics collection in Subtask 2.2.3.
