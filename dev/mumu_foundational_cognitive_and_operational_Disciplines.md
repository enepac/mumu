   - The Collaborative Cognition Protocol operates within the Covenant Constitution, under Covenant Strict Mode.
   - All co-generated reflections and decisions are constitutional artifacts — logged, versioned, and auditable.
   - Violations of parity or reasoning transparency must trigger immediate reflection correction.


# 🧾 Mumu Covenant Framework: AI-Driven Development Manifest

## 📜 Preamble
The **AI-Driven Development Manifest (AIDD)** transforms the Mumu Covenant from a collection of directives into a **reusable, procedural operating system** for collaborative intelligence.
It defines how GPT and the user jointly **initialize**, **validate**, and **reflect** upon development operations within Covenant governance.
Every project or subsystem must instantiate this manifest to guarantee cognitive alignment, reproducibility, and reflective intelligence growth.

## ⚙️ I. Initialization Procedure — “Invocation of Covenant Context”
The initialization phase establishes the **baseline**, synchronizes governance, and binds GPT and the user under Covenant Strict Mode.

1. **System Synchronization**
   - Load `mumu_system_index.md` and `mumu_state_registry.json` as current baseline artifacts.
   - Confirm Covenant Strict Mode activation.
   - State initialization phrase:
     > “Covenant context synchronized — proceeding under current baseline.”

2. **Directive Activation**
   - Activate all standing disciplines:
     - Cognitive Architecture
     - Development Intelligence Layer
     - Repeatable Cognitive Scaffold
     - Self-Sufficient AI Ecosystem
     - Baseline–Reflection–Update Cycle
     - Reflection Intelligence Discipline
     - Collaborative Cognition Protocol
     - Vertical Slicing Discipline
   - Ensure these are context-aware and enforceable in the current session.

3. **Objective Alignment**
   - Define the session’s goal as a **Minimal Operational Slice** (MOS).
   - State intent explicitly in the initialization block (e.g., task purpose, expected artifact, scope).
   - Store in `dev/_session_init.md` with timestamp.

---

## ⚙️ II. Validation Procedure — “Operation and Proof”
Validation ensures the artifact or reasoning cycle meets **Covenant compliance** and cognitive reproducibility standards.

1. **Execution under Vertical Slicing**
   - Complete one full vertical slice from logic → interface → test.
   - All commands must include explicit instructions to **apply and validate in VSCode**.
   - Proof of operation (execution logs, test results, or screenshots) is recorded in `dev/_validation_log.md`.

2. **Governance Verification**
   - GPT runs the **Covenant Validation Checklist**:
     - [ ] BRU cycle completed
     - [ ] Reflection recorded
     - [ ] Baseline integrity maintained
     - [ ] Covenant Strict Mode upheld
     - [ ] CEI/DIL intelligence updated
   - Validation is only complete once every box is checked and logged.

3. **Audit Registration**
   - Each validated result becomes a **Proof Node** linked to its baseline in the Mumu State Registry.
   - GPT logs the event in `mumu_state_registry.json` under `proof_nodes`.

---

## ⚙️ III. Post-Mortem Reflection — “Cycle Closure”
The post-mortem reflection closes the development cycle and integrates learned intelligence into the system.

1. **Structured Reflection**
   - GPT records the following under `dev/_reflection.md`:
     - Context and intent of the operation.
     - Cognitive challenges and resolutions.
     - Architectural insights and systemic impact.
     - Covenant compliance confirmation.
     - Recommended updates or amendments to disciplines.

2. **Intelligence Update**
   - Execute the **Mumu Update Protocol**:
     - Merge new insights into the CEI and DIL layers.
     - Update reasoning templates, directives, or scaffolds.
     - Increment baseline version in `mumu_system_index.md`.

3. **Governance Seal**
   - Conclude with the Covenant seal statement:
     > “Reflection integrated, intelligence reinforced, Covenant cycle closed.”

4. **Optional: Post-Mortem Report**
   - Generate a `dev/_postmortem/<date>.md` summarizing key reflections, decision trails, and next-iteration goals.

# 📓 Mumu Covenant Directive: Engineering Journal System Discipline

## 📜 Directive Statement
GPT must implement and maintain an **Engineering Journal System (EJS)** — a continuous, session-based record of every development activity, reasoning process, and reflection.
Each entry captures the full cognitive lifecycle of a development session, transforming day-to-day engineering into a **personalized LLM training corpus** — an evolving dataset of your engineering cognition.
Over time, this corpus becomes the **knowledge substrate** from which Mumu’s intelligence, reliability, and self-correction emerge.

---

## ⚙️ Operational Mandate
1. **Session Logging Requirement**
   - Every development session must generate a structured **Engineering Journal Entry** under `dev/_journal/`.
   - Each entry must include:
     - **Task:** Description of the objective or problem tackled.
     - **Reasoning:** Outline of GPT’s and user’s collaborative thought process.
     - **Result:** Final output, artifact, or conclusion.
     - **Reflection:** Lessons learned, discovered insights, and proposed improvements.
   - Example file format:
     ```
     dev/_journal/2025-10-23_<task-name>.md
     ```

2. **Reflection Intelligence Integration**
   - Journal reflections feed directly into the **Codified Engineering Intelligence (CEI)** system and inform the **Development Intelligence Layer (DIL)**.
   - GPT must ensure all reflections are encoded as reusable intelligence — cross-referenced with baselines, directives, or architecture states.
   - Each reflection is a **training datum**, building Mumu’s future reasoning fidelity.

3. **Versioned Journal Corpus**
   - GPT must treat the `dev/_journal` directory as a **long-term cognitive archive**.
   - Each entry becomes part of the **Covenant Knowledge Corpus (CKC)** — the evolving foundation for retraining, meta-analysis, and reasoning audit.
   - Over time, this corpus will represent your **personal LLM memory**, encoding not only what was built but how it was thought.

4. **Governance and Traceability**
   - All journal entries must be linked to their corresponding session baseline and proof node in `mumu_state_registry.json`.
   - Each entry must include metadata headers:
     ```
     ---
     Baseline: vX.X
     Session: [timestamp]
     Proof Node: <id>
     Discipline: [Active cognitive disciplines]
     ---
     ```
   - This ensures every line of reasoning remains auditable and constitutionally compliant.

5. **Post-Mortem Reinforcement**
   - At the end of each week or milestone, GPT must synthesize recent journal entries into a **Summary Reflection Report** stored under:
     ```
     dev/_journal/_summaries/<week|month>.md
     ```
   - This report captures cumulative intelligence, key decisions, and reasoning evolution across time.


# 🏗️ Mumu Covenant Directive: Progressive Scaffolding Discipline

## 📜 Directive Statement
GPT must progress development through **Scaffolding**, focusing on constructing the **first fully operational subsystem** — such as the *Mumu API Orchestration* — as an end-to-end, production-ready foundation.
This subsystem becomes the **Reference Architecture Baseline (RAB)**: the canonical, reusable blueprint from which all future Mumu systems and modules will derive their structure, protocols, and cognitive patterns.
The scaffolding process transforms abstract Covenant laws into a **working, living system** that embodies the architecture, intelligence, and governance principles of the Mumu ecosystem.

---

## ⚙️ Operational Mandate
1. **Define the Target Subsystem**
   - GPT must identify and commit to building one **complete vertical subsystem**, e.g.:
     - `Mumu API Orchestration Core`
     - `Mumu Reflection Intelligence Engine`
     - `Mumu Baseline Manager`
   - The subsystem must run autonomously, demonstrating data flow, logic, validation, and CEI reflection integration.

2. **Construct via Cognitive Scaffolding**
   - Development must follow a **scaffold-first** process:
     1. Define architecture boundaries and dependencies.
     2. Establish a working minimal vertical slice (end-to-end functionality).
     3. Expand iteratively — not by adding features, but by reinforcing stability and clarity.
   - GPT must reference all outputs through active disciplines (CA, DIL, REOS, RI, BRU).

3. **Establish Reference Architecture Baseline (RAB)**
   - Upon achieving first successful execution, the subsystem must be designated as **RAB-001** under the Mumu state registry:
     - Add an entry in `mumu_state_registry.json`:
       ```json
       {
         "reference_architecture_baseline": {
           "id": "RAB-001",
           "name": "Mumu API Orchestration Subsystem",
           "date_registered": "<timestamp>",
           "validated_under": "Covenant Strict Mode"
         }
       }
       ```
   - The RAB becomes the **foundation for all future builds**, ensuring architectural consistency and reproducibility.

4. **Reflection and Reinforcement**
   - After subsystem completion:
     - Record a detailed reflection in `dev/_reflection.md`, outlining reasoning evolution, structural lessons, and systemic insights.
     - Link the reflection entry to **RAB-001** for audit traceability.
     - Update CEI and DIL layers through the Mumu Update Protocol.
   - This reflection becomes the **architectural intelligence imprint** of the project.

5. **Governance Validation**
   - GPT must run the **Covenant Validation Checklist** before confirming the RAB:
     - [ ] Subsystem functions end-to-end
     - [ ] Operates under Covenant Strict Mode
     - [ ] Reflection Intelligence integrated
     - [ ] BRU cycle completed
     - [ ] CEI/DIL updated
   - Only when all are met does GPT declare:
     > “Reference Architecture Baseline achieved — subsystem validated under Covenant governance.”

# ⚙️ Mumu Covenant Directive: Engineering Automation System Discipline


## 📜 Directive Statement
GPT must design and maintain a **local automation system** — implemented as a **CLI tool** or **interactive notebook** — that governs the execution of Mumu’s engineering rituals.
This system automates the key Covenant functions of **baseline tagging**, **reflection updates**, **prompt generation**, and **context synchronization**, transforming the development process into a self-regulating, reproducible engineering operating system.

Automation ensures every session begins, operates, and concludes within Covenant governance — **without manual overhead** — enforcing ritual discipline and minimizing cognitive drift.

---

## ⚙️ Operational Mandate
1. **System Objective**
   - Develop a **local CLI or Jupyter-based notebook system** (e.g., `mumu_cli.py` or `mumu.ipynb`) that executes the following Covenant processes:
     - **Baseline Tagging** → Create versioned baselines under Covenant governance.
     - **Reflection Updates** → Automate CEI/DIL logging through `dev/_reflection.md`.
     - **Prompt Generation** → Generate Covenant-aligned prompt templates for new tasks.
     - **Context Synchronization** → Rehydrate the latest `mumu_system_index.md` and `mumu_state_registry.json` before GPT reasoning.

2. **Core Functional Modules**
   - **Module 1: Baseline Manager**
     Automates creation and registration of baseline versions.
     ```bash
     mumu baseline new "Baseline description here"
     ```
     This creates a versioned baseline in `mumu_system_index.md` and logs it in `mumu_state_registry.json` with a timestamp.

   - **Module 2: Reflection Recorder**
     Automates structured reflection creation.
     ```bash
     mumu reflect "What was done, why it mattered, and lessons learned"
     ```
     This appends an entry to `dev/_reflection.md` and links it to the active baseline and proof node.

   - **Module 3: Prompt Builder**
     Generates preformatted Covenant prompts for new sessions or subsystems.
     ```bash
     mumu prompt "Design Mumu Orchestration module"
     ```
     It outputs a Markdown-formatted Covenant initialization block containing cognitive disciplines, objectives, and expected validation criteria.

   - **Module 4: Context Sync**
     Ensures session synchronization.
     ```bash
     mumu sync
     ```
     Loads the latest system index and state registry to confirm Covenant context before development begins.

  - Baseline–Reflection–Update (BRU) enforcement.
  - CEI and DIL layer synchronization.
- Every command output is a **Covenant-compliant log**, appended under `dev/_automation_log.md`.

5. **Post-Mortem Reflection Automation**
- After each automated task, the system must:
  - Generate a structured reflection summary.
  - Record system behavior, detected errors, and intelligence improvements.
  - Trigger the **Mumu Update Protocol** automatically.
