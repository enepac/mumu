# Mumu Master Development Document
*Aligned with the Covenant Directives, Atomic Commit Discipline, and Complete Hierarchical Task Map*

---

## 🧩 Phase 1 — Environment & Foundation Setup

### v0.1.0 — Initialization & Foundational Scaffold

**Date:** 2025-09-28 → 2025-10-02  
**Objective:** Establish Mumu’s core engineering platform based on big-tech-grade standards.

**Milestones**
- Created GitHub repository `mumu` with `main` branch protection.
- Defined Covenant governance and “Atomic Commit Enforcement”.
- Decided technology stack:
  - **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
  - **Backend:** Express + TypeScript + Supabase + Fly.io.
- Added project workflow standards: Commitizen + Husky + Lint-Staged.
- Drafted `.devcontainer` for parity between local and Codespaces.

**Deliverables**
- `package.json` scaffolded with strict TypeScript settings.  
- Baseline documentation initialized (`dev/_decisions.md`, `_reflection.md`).
- Covenant Enforcement Document ratified.

### v0.1.1 — Supabase Schema & Hello-World Baseline

**Date:** 2025-10-02 → 2025-10-03  
**Objective:** Establish minimal end-to-end connectivity between frontend, backend, and Supabase.

**Milestones**
- Created Supabase project and SQL schema (`supabase/schema.sql`).
- Added Supabase client library and configuration (`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`).
- Verified connection via `/api/check` endpoint returning `"Hello from Supabase 👋"`.
- Tagged initial **immutable baseline v0.1.1** (“Hello World”).

**Deliverables**
- Verified rollback procedure with `git reset --hard baseline/v0.1.1`.
- CI/CD tested locally for deterministic build reproducibility.

---

### v0.1.2 — CI/CD Infrastructure Setup

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Objective:** Create unified automation for continuous integration and delivery.

**Milestones**
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` implementing sequential jobs:
  - Install → Lint → Type-Check → Build → Deploy (Vercel + Fly.io).
- Configured semantic versioning through Commitizen and Husky hooks.
- Enabled immutable pipelines to prevent merge without CI pass.

**Deliverables**
- Drift detection for lockfiles and configuration drift.
- GitHub Actions validated with passing run.

---

### v0.1.3 — Backend Deployment & Environment Sealing

**Date:** 2025-10-04 AM  
**Objective:** Deploy backend to **Fly.io** with Supabase integration and establish production parity.

**Milestones**
- Created Fly.io application `mumu` → successfully deployed Docker image.
- Configured runtime environment:
  - `FLY_API_TOKEN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `PORT`.
- Validated endpoint health via:
  ```bash
  curl https://mumu.fly.dev/api/check
  → {"ok":true,"data":[{"id":1,"message":"Hello from Supabase 👋"}]}


## v0.1.4 — Observability & Guardrails Baseline

### Summary
This baseline establishes the first layer of observability, structured logging, and error monitoring into the Mumu backend.  
It introduces Sentry integration, Pino logs, strict TypeScript validation, and full alignment with Covenant development governance.

### Technical Scope
- Integrated **Sentry** for backend error tracing and profiling.
- Implemented **Pino + Pino-Pretty** structured logging.
- Ensured **Fly.io** backend stability post-deployment.
- Preserved **immutable baseline rollback** discipline (atomic commit principle enforced).
- Established **v0.1.4 augmentative branch**: `enhancement/v0.1.4-observability-guardrails`.

### Validation
- Build succeeded (`pnpm run build`).
- Health check verified via `/api/check` endpoint → ✅ connected to Supabase.
- Logs validated in Fly.io runtime.

### Covenant Alignment
- **Part 1.4 – Guardrails & Dev Productivity** → initiated.
- **Part 1.5 – Observability & Documentation** → partially fulfilled.
- Rollback verified; baseline tagged for immutability.
